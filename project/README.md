This entity relationship model represents package delivery company. The model shows how every customer can keep track of every package they purchased and can view the billing
information for every individual transaction. It is presumed that package delivery company has acquired staff and transport like planes or trucks. It is also assumed that 
the company works in many countries and has different range of outposts. The price of delivery depends on type of service. Customers have the option to make prepaid transactions
or to choose the monthly-billing option for the account of the seller/supplier. The delivery datastamp is recorded and the datastamp for every changing delivery event is planned
to be monitored. Every instance of location is documented. Also every delivery deal assigns dependent operators beforehand. In the event of any unforeseen crash event, information
about delivery can be gathered.
