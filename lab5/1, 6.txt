1. BCNF method is not always reliable for dependency preserving. For example:
R = (A, B, C); AB -> C, C -> B; C is not prime attribute

Decomposition: R1 = (C, A); R2 = (C, B); but AB -> C is lost

BCNF is convenient for ensuring data integrity and less redundancy

6. 1) Avoid data redundancy - some data may be unnecessarily stored because it
is repeated. In order to save resources, that should be taken into account.
   2) Data integrity - data should be synchronized across all tables since
we don't want contradictions in tables.
   3) Dependency preserving decompositions - preservation of all dependencies
is important since we need to remember what identifies what

   Decomposition which provides lossless join - natural join with no data loss
                                lossy join - we lost some data when dividing
tables
